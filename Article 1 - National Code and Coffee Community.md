# Article of Understanding 1 - National Code and Coffee Community

## Purpose 
Code and Coffee Community is a minimally formal national organization that aims to create in person communities centered around software development across the United States. Our aim is to help individuals feel more connected by creating by creating oppertunities for folks to connect over a common facination.

This Article of Understanding aims to minimally formalize the goals of National Code and Coffee Community and outline the relationship between national and Local Communities.

## Principles
Code and Coffee Community holds to the following set of principles with how we operate.  

- **Minimal Formality**:  
The goal of Code and Coffee Community is to create Local Communities that individuals feel personally connected too. While we help our community members in achieving their personal goals like improving their skill sets and getting a job, our main purpose is creating interpersonal connections. We recognize that overly formal structures are inately antagonistic to the personal relationships that we aim to create. At the same time we realize that no formal structures whatsoever can make it difficult to maintain communities over long periods of time due to burnout that comes to the uneven distribution of effort. As such we aim to minimize the amount of formality with our processes to just what is neccesary to avoid the negative effects of a lack of formality. Instead decisions should be made though public discussions and consensus.

- **Local Autonomy**:  
Our main goal is to create personal communities. The kind of place where folks know your name and support you in your life goals. These kinds of communities can only develop if local organizers and leaders have a sense of ownership over how their community are run and structured. National Code and Coffee Community should respect Local Autonomy to its maximal degree. Local Communities should always be given the option to opt out of National programs an1d plans when so far it is possible and practical. National Code and Coffee Community may give reccomendations to Local Communities on how they are structured, but they may not require Local Communities to be structured in any particular way. 

## Local Community Expectations

- **Intro Circle**:  
All Local Communities should start all meetups with an intro circle. All attendees should be given the oppertunity to introduce themselves to the community. The Local Community has full discretion on how this is performed, the kinds of questions asked, and the length of time an intro is given. This is the sole unifying ritual that all Code and Coffee Local Communities perform. This helps start conversations while encouraging everyone to be personal.

- **Regular Predictable Meetups**:  
Strong communities need both time and space to grow. Local Communities should aim to meet at regular intervals, monthly or bi weekly, at predictable times in predictable places. This predictability and cadence creates confidence in the commuinty members that the community is worth investing emotional energy into. This also allows regular attendees the time to be able to get to know each other quicker.

- **In Person Meetups**:  
Code and Coffee aims to be a place for folks to connect authenticically away from the digital space. Events should be primarily in person focused. This allows for more genuine connection between the community members compared to less personal digital spaces.

- **No Cost**:  
Code and Coffee aims to be inclusive of individuals from all backgrounds. Each Local Community's regular meetups should have no cost to attend. Other events that the Local Community holds may have a cost associated with it, but the costs should only be used to offset the costs of hosting the event and should be kept as minimal as feasible. There should also be no membership fees or dues for being a community member in Code and Coffee.

- **Don't be a Jerk**:  
Just don't be a jerk. Organizers, community members, and anyone interacting with or in Code and Coffee should refrain from being a jerk. The Local Community should aim to be safe to all attendees regardless of background. This includes the amount of technical experience as well as personal traits like gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, race, national origin, if they like pineapple pizza, or any others. There should be an expectation of a respect of others opinions and backgrounds. Requests to change topics of conversation should always be respected.

## National Structure
Following our principle of Minimal Formality, National Code and Coffee Community strives to follow minimal structure. The main aim of National Code and Coffee Community is to help new Local Communities get started and to provide assistance to existing Local Communities to help their communities thrive. Ideally Local Communites should only be worried about taking care of their communities while National takes care of things that the Local Communities would rather not handle. This reduces the friction of startig new Local Communities and reduces the burden of operation for existing chatpers. There are advantages that we can gain by banding together many communities across the country. National aims at utilizing this banding effect to help all the communities. So long as a community remains affiliated with National Code and Coffee Community they may benefit to this organization.  

### National Benefits
* **Covering Meetup.com (or equivilant)**:  
National aims to cover the cost of each Local Community's Meetup.com, or equivilant, event managment service. By banding together many Local Communities, National can ensure the best rate overall.  

* **Discord**:  
National provides the cost and manages the administration of a National Discord. Each community should be provided their own space in the discord to manage their local communities, but their community members can further participate in the national Community.

* **Fiscal Hosting**:  
National provides a method for all Local Communities to accept and manage their finances. This removes the burden for Local Communities to have to figure out their own personal fiscal hosting method. Following the Local Autonomy principle, Local Communities are not required to use the National fiscal hosting solution, but is offered if they are not interesting in persuing their own.

* **National Website and Social Media**:  
National maintains the National Code and Coffee Community website and social media accounts. This makes it easier for Local Communities to get discovered and grow.

* **Notion**:  
National provides administration and covers the cost for Notion. This helps local communities organize and makes it easier for different communities to share best practices.

* **Guidence**:  
All the individuals involved on the National level should be experienced and involved organizers of local Code and Coffee communities. National thus can provide advice and guidence to best practices for chaptesr. They can further help disperse effective ideas between communities allowing all the communities to benefit from the collective experience.

* **Custodians of the Brand**:  
Code and Coffee as a National brand is valuable for Local Communities to get venues and sponorships. National aims at being a proper custodian of this brand by acting as primary represenatives. While all Local Communities retain the right to use the brand as they see fit, so long as they are following principles and expectations, National remains as the primary source of truth that outside partners can trust.

* **Coordinate Additional Efforts**:  
National aims to coordinate the efforts of all the other Local Communities to make it easier for them to operate, gain financial sponsorships, or obtain venues. National shall respect the principle of local autonomy and not force participation in any effort, but provides these efforts in an opt in basis. National may restrict some or all of the benefits to these additional efforts to only to the communities that opt in, but this should not be used as a method to force compliance.

### Organization
National Code and Coffee has one formal office, the Executive Director of National Code and Coffee Community. This office is served at the pleasure of all the Local Communities, and the Local Communities retain the right to select the Executive Director. The Executive Director aims to run the National organization to achieve the benefits set in this Article. The Executive Director may select other individuals into additional National level positions at their discretion. The Executive Director retains the right to act on behalf of all the communities affiliated with Code and Coffee while respecting the Local Autonomy of all the Local Communities.

## Articles of Understanding
Following the principle of minimal formality, National Code and Coffee Community does not have any bylaws, rules, or charter. Instead, National has Articles of Understanding that lay out the fundemental principles of operation. It is up to communities to determine the best processes to carry out the Articles of Understanding.  
  
Articles of Understanding are inspired by the W3C reccomendation process.  
  
All the Articles of Understandings are held in a publically accessible repository. Any community member in Code and Coffee may make reccomendations to add, remove, or change things in the articles of understanding. These change reccomendations will be referred to as a Request For Comment (RFC). Any member of the community may make their opinion heard on the reccomendation and reccomendations should only be adopted when there is near consensus on it.
  
This is the change process for the articles:  
  
1) A member creates a branch of the repository to make their changes in. Once they are satisfied with their changes they then open a pull request with the title "RFC # - [title]" where # is the sequential number of the RFC and title is a human readable title overviewing what the RFC is for. The pull request should include a description of the rationale for the change. The pull request should act as the central point of discussion around the topic.

2) The RFC should be sent out in a general chat available to all community members across all our Local Communities. 

3) The RFC should be made available for comment for a fair period of time, at least 1 week.

4) The RFC can only be accepted if there are no current conversations being had and that general consensus has been reached. Community members may accept or reject the RFC to show their approval or disapproval of the RFC. Community members that disapprove must make their disapproval clear and must be engaged in the discussion if their disapproval is contingent on a part of the RFC instead of the core idea of the RFC. Community members that disapprove who do not make their perspective clear may be overlooked. If consensus of the community members cannot be reached, a 2/3 consensus of the Local Communities, where each Local Communites has a single opinion, may be used in replacement. Local Communities abstain by default if they do not let themselves be heard. Each Local Community may choose their own method of deciding their Local Community's opinion. The default process is a simple majority opinion of all the members participating in the RFC conversation.

5) Once the RFC has been accepted, it will be merged into the main branch.
